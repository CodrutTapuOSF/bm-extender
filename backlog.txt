General navigation
    Add a list of recently visited sections at the top of the page.


Logs
    Make file listing the table columns clickable so you can sort by the most recently updated.
    See if there is a way to detect the file size (maybe a head request) and skip the highlight
    for large files.
    See if there is a way to intercept the requests to the logs so we cancel the original
    one and instead we load the last X bytes of the file (using the range header).


WebDav
    Add some options to upload files via drag and drop.
    Add some options to delete files via the web interface.
    Make the sections of indexOf clickable (like a breadcrumb)
    Reuse the sorting logic from the logs section.

Options page
    Add a nicer notification on the save action.
